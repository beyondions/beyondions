@beyondions here. Welcome. My goal is to make something new that can be inspirational for many groups. At the moment, I am studying computer engineering. Additionally, I'm learning programming skills (Java, Python, C language), data structures, and algorithms. My goal is to gain experience through Java applications and participate in real-life projects. You can reach me at: akshayshah2152@gmail.com
